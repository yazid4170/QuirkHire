# Missing Features and Improvements Before Deployment

After the latest review, the following features and improvements are still missing or incomplete:

## 1. Legal Pages
- No Terms of Service or Privacy Policy pages/components are present.
- These are important for user trust and compliance.

## 2. Accessibility & Responsiveness
- Some pages/components may lack accessibility improvements (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, etc.).
- Ensure all pages are fully responsive on mobile devices.

## 3. Route Integration
- If new pages are added (e.g., legal pages), update the router to include these routes and set up a fallback for 404 pages if not already done.

## 4. User Settings
- No dedicated user settings page for changing password/email.

## 5. Test Coverage
- Add basic test coverage for critical flows (login, signup, profile update).

**Recommendation:**
- Implement the above features for a more complete, user-friendly, and production-ready deployment.
- Prioritize legal compliance, accessibility, and test coverage next.
